_The Right vs Left debate has become the debate of the century in Indian society. While this might seem to have been a fairly new concept, to us as Indians, it is not! The centuries might have passed by, but stark similarities with the Devas vs Asuras debate comes to mind when you have read history. If you are aware of the Ramayana and Mahabharata or any other sacred Indian texts, you might be familiar with the Masculine vs Feminine debate._

We are riding an obvious wave. Not the Modi wave or as such any other oscillating change in the sea that is society, but a regular function of time. For example take the governments in Kerala which are formed by the alternator function. It has so far consisted of two extremes that are the United and the Left (Democratic Fronts which I know aren’t very good examples for this). The 4th dimension defines the choice of the people for the consolidation of power.

As an example let’s only consider the ‘since writing part’, as I like to point out to those ignorant of deep history (what I call the ancient past, including so called myths). we have moved through three eras and are at the dawn of the fourth. We know that some 3000 years have passed since the Egyptians had a system of Pharaohs holding power i.e. the Feminine-masculine. The Greeks came next with their Feminist law and order. The Romans continued the rule of law but with their Emperor and Senate system representing that of the USA’s Masculine-femininity. The Masculine reemerged in the period of time we know of as the Dark-ages. This happened in a period way before the British ruled much of the world in their monarchical empire of great similarity with the Egyptians. That all broke up in war, with another obvious dictatorial regime in the Nazi system. That is, lets presume, power moving through all these systems in a damped-oscillation wave formation.

Now you might disprove me in the fact that the societal change has been addressed, at the handover in 1947, but that was just another Feminine change. From Pagan Rome to Catholic Rome and then from Pagan Arabia to Islamic Arabia the power of belief in Semitic culture changed hands. All of this did happen and strangely India remained pagan. Why the obvious change of consolidating power of belief under one system not take place? It is a thought to be processed by philosophical societies. The truth is that this multiplicity remained a symbol for India being open and ready to change. While Buddhism was a call to unite, we did not take it with much vigour. This led to so many changes in society, we broke past the records in our own fashion and changed the way we lived. We took our motherland for granted and imposed a ruthless system meant for another era. We suppressed our own kind and looked at others with an eye of suspicion, even if we knew they held no motive against us, bringing forth the last era of complete Masculinity.

This is why we should repent, we forced masses into pseudo slavery. It might be time as they say for an introspection. We need to find that inherent kindness and humanity and love for our own kind, we need to see that all are on the same path and that is common interest. We are to bring peace at home and then abroad. To do that we need to stop fighting for lost purpose and find reasons to unite. As a collective we need to understand that the benefits of the past are nullified by the cause at present. We are at a point where we need to abolish an unjust system which provides social benefits on the basis of birth. Let there be worship of some divine or the other, that is not what has to be interfered with as might be professed by the Communists. But the inhuman practice of seeing oneself closer to good on the grounds of birth, as done by some ultra right groups, is unjust. It is time we saw to it that nothing but one’s contributions makes them the person they are. We should not punish those who don’t believe but try to give to them an image of purity in belief so that we need not indulge in violence to achieve peace.
