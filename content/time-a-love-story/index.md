I have lived, I want to live a little more, but is it time, now?

So, everyone has this unique, _love-hate_ relationship with time. It is all too often that some just take to **bashing** this precious resource. But have we ever tried to shine light on the awesome powers of time and of the times we spent with genuine pleasure?

Maybe we have, maybe not. It depends on a lot of factors. I am not a judge great enough to deny time any respects while we accuse it as a suspect — **_prima facie_**, nonetheless — for the misery of missed deadlines and the lack of organization in our lives. Yes, it is true that time flies when we are happy and it slows down in times of pain. We take it for granted, yes we do! We binge watch or play, when we could have just finished a lesson or two. We fill in the gaps at the work-place, get some overtime-hours clocked-in for that oh-so-good bonus. But have we ever wanted to make the time count and actually lived in the moment?

#### What else would you rather use your time…

I don’t want to miss that smile, **_be it wry or joyful_**. I want to have all the time in my life for living that beautiful dream, **_be it in my sleep or in action_**. I want to have some time set away for myself(not in loneliness, but solitude) but I also want some to be spent among friends. I’d also want the time to make new friends, but also to draw my borders for others to respect. I want to use my time to earn, but I also want to spend some, to volunteer or to just give. I want to make a change, but I also want to keep convention. I want to be the role model, but also keep the weird. But after all my friends, my lover, keeps her cards drawn close.

I know it **_sounds crazy_**, it did to me the first time too, but time is all just in you. Consciously or not, we make the time and we destroy it too. It is tough to make her dance by our tunes, but she flows, be it a pace too soon. Yes, time doesn’t dance for you, it dances with you. She will be on your side, only if you are by her. She is the **_ultimate side-kick_**, making dangerous commitments seems easy as two.

Time for me, has been the worst of friends, the best of enemies and least of troubles. Don’t get me wrong, she never was friend, nor foe, nor a living thing to be sure. She kept to her word, giving me the best and the worst, a blue pill for every red one pushed down my throat.

If you were to ask me why I care, I’d ask as to how you live with a stranger, in so intimate yet distant a relationship, when she’s invisible… and I dare say too loudly, the darnedest of visible tragedies in everyone’s life.

> Time is human? Time is immaterial? are you sure it is the fourth dimension?

It might be a bit of a stretch to call it about time, but we are in year-end season, so let me say it nonetheless, you have something you can make, break or even reject. But there’s also the elephant in the room, something you can never change by your own(I don’t want to hurt the Doctor Strange fans here). What will you choose to make the most out of, the decision is up to you, the arbitration of how you spend time, will now most probably cause trauma, but be rest assured that the time is still there to make the last of your opportunities — to live, to explore and to make the change you live for — come true!

I plead, remember once more, that time, for now(keeping in minds the _BTTF_ fans), only moves into the future. There in lies the one thing we can all agree upon, she is stubborn and refuses to give us what we all want, the chance to `Ctrl+Z` when faced with the grim choice to `Shift+del`. Time is true, but believe me when I say it, there is nothing more true than the way you make use of it. Be it for good or bad.

I might **not** be the regular romantic, but I am human nonetheless, with some strong emotions. Forgive me for making some of the most absurd sounding claims, but I have said enough that can be held against me in time. I am the hypocrite that I am and make me noted, for I will keep wasting time the way I have. _“But isn’t something in excess meant to be exposed to regeneration?”_ I’ll ask when placed on trial, for I know that I have only committed, the most human of all sins.

This has not been an ode to time, she is too humble to take her praise too lightly. I am pretty sure she’ll be back with more, the human imperfection she so perfectly flaunts. After all, the time might be up, for me to say sorry, for the awful things I did, especially for your time, that I so skillfully, murdered :P

I rest my case.

**P.S:** I don’t intend to pass on a gender to time, but I have grown to respect it as an equal, for me she is a constant, in rapid change. Also, this piece has been in the pipeline for a **_long time_**, let’s just say a few years… So, if you appreciated it, do let me know! :D
