So, I am student of the sciences and personally have always dreaded the narrow outlook of teachers of PCM in my school. I want to confess that up until choosing Computer Science as a selective for my Senior High years in school, what we call +2 in India, I was sure that my choice would be Biology. Now I thank god for not having let me do that. It is not so that I hate it now, it is just that, now I have come to understand that the truth is, I would never have been able to do the unthinkable.
