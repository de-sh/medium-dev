#### Gear UP

As a geek you are going to be eco-friendly. At least if you use less paper and ink, you do become eco-friendly, so get a PC or upgrade the one with winXP. Note:- Never use pirated OS’s, using Linux gives you better GeekXP(if you don’t get the pun, google ‘eXperience Points’ because for all geeks, GOOGLE is your Guru!) .

Get an internet connection, no not to download movies, get it to read this and other articles to increase your exposure to the world of technology. Then create an account on any email provider if you don’t have one(just google it). Create an account on all the relevant Social networks (do I have to say this?).

Go to any hosting provider like Google’s Blogspot, Wordpress, Weebly, etc… Get up and write an article on anything and publish it as a blog. Get a theme to change the looks of your website. Soon you can make one if you want to, maybe even create everything related to the website yourself!!

#### Create

![Create content to become great again..](./asset-2.jpeg)

You made a mark, but is a spot enough? Get a domain name for free or as cheap as $1 at certain providers. If you want to select a free domain provider, one that is preferred by me would be [freenom](http://freenom.com). Otherwise [hostinger](http://hostinger.com) also provides you with free sub-domains and limited hosting spaces.

If you like making videos, the best services to provide people with your content other than Facebook would be [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com). Do you take photos? Great, I do too! and I use [Flickr](http://flickr.com) which lets you upload up to 1TB of content. No, I am not joking!

If you are interested make your content available to other audience such as aspiring programmers and other content creators. As a matter of fact all the content depictions(Pictures) made in this article are from [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) which provides photographers with the ability to share their pictures to people like us, content creators.
