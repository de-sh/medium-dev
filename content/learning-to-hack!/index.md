## Sorry for the misleading title, but hacking is not just what you think…

![](./asset-1.jpeg)

**I am a noob**, let me get that straight. Now, back to what I want to say. Hacking is creativity (being creative is also what criminals do… awkward silence, but leaving that aside), we can say Programmers — a rather more creative term for them being ‘Software Developers’ — are the coolest form of hackers. So what I will be writing about is simple, just a short introduction to how I learned to code, in school.

**My story**

This is not self-promotion \[ ;) \], but merely insight. While you can’t say learning HTML is programming, I learned it at the age of 8 from an awareness class on computers. At the time, I barely knew how to type well — and I still don’t — but from here I learn the basics of web development. The truth be said, this is all I really did with computers at that age, I build HTML templates and delete. Mind me this is the age of HTML 4. Yes, I did by heart the following snippet.

After my adventures with HTML, I sure did not have access to the internet still and all the advice I got about computers was “Son, learn Java”, and I did. Let’s just say that I skimmed through a book on it, I left it halfway through. Other than the fact that it was boring, I also did not want to bear the brunt of the owner of the computer center from where I had stolen the book. I know, that was a really bad move on my part.

I learned to code — for reals this time — with the basics of C++, in 2009. My dad used to buy(He still prefers to not subscribe) a computer magazine by the name of [digit](http://digit.in), and he was trying to build a PC for us. An issue of the magazine came along with a supplementary called “the Fast Track to C++” that is how I stepped onto code land. We connected to the internet at home in 2011. How I learned more coding/hacking/computers is a **bit**, you know — **illegal**. But at that time there existed no [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/). I had soon learned some topics on objects and classes, functions and more. This was also the time when I built my first Linux Machine, It ran Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but no one at home really cared, I brought down three Windows Installs in a span of 4 months. The PC was some how, not powerful enough to run Unity…

**The difficult times**

I was depressed by how school life gets nerve racking in middle school. I left the world of programming, on an hiatus, only to ‘recover’ from, years later. It is difficult to write about, but learning to code is a consuming task. You devote weeks only learning the basics, if you are in a school that lets you take a course on programming when you are in 8th grade. Otherwise you end up wasting time, no one used to teach for free, few were interested, but to no avail.

I am self-taught, though I did learn from [Udemy](http://udemy.com/), [edX](http://edx.org/), [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) and everyone’s favorite, Google(I didn’t link it because I know you, Mwahahaha!). I was not much the studious type, I got less-than-average grades regularly. But in computers I found my Empire! a place I can do things that children of my age could not. I would soon go on to making blogs with WordPress and free hosting providers and domain services. That is how I justify tagging myself as ‘Web Developer’, though I know that I am really not certified.

There, always exists a time when you begin, soon enough you loose focus, become irritated by many challenges. If you persist you are different, otherwise count me in. I was not determined of being a programmer at first, I dreamt of a day when I would race in an F1 car. Fate said otherwise, I was not the athletic type and have horrific mental replays of embarrassing events, bullies and stuff. That is when I changed tracks, became engrossed with coding, starting with a refresher in HTML, CSS and JS. I soon conquered courses on Codecademy and built a few websites to waste what was my only years left in school.

**Entrepreneurship**

I was always the individualist type. I liked being a team leader, other than in school dramas. So I believe it is important that everyone tries to do projects, like websites in teams and exchange roles regularly. It helped me build a blog, but try to have responsible members, I didn’t judge so V! occurred.

I also feel that the availability of an idea to work on is umpteen to the process of learning. When you know what to build with your skill you are setup for the challenges that are thrown at you.

Maybe time will tell, but if you are not special, don’t fret, I am not. Most of the world is not special, a few might be, but that is the beauty of being Human. You can always be more special than you ever were, because all those who care are the closest to you, in you to be exact. All the people you have to work for, well it’s just you! My life has been a mess, but then that shows I am human, doesn’t it.
